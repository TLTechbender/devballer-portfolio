# Responsive Personal Portfolio Website

# Another one
I'm still learning the ropes and I'm getting better.

# Lesson learnt
* How to create dark mode for websites (This is my second one and spoiler alert, it is as buggy as the last one).
* How to use the interaction observer API.
* How to create a basic swiper / carousel.
* How to create basic animations for websites, smooth animations hit different, but in this case, I still kept it buggy.

## Installation
 To install:
 -Download or clone the repo
 ```
git clone https://github.com/TLTechbender/devballer-portfolio.git
 ```

 ## HELP!!
Suggestions and improvements would mean a lot to me, feel free to pull the repo and make it even better.
I think I wrote too many media queries for this website, I guess it's all part of learning, next time I'ma try to plan better.

 ### PROCESS
 This was built using a Mobile First approach.
